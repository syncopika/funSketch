buggy stuff / refactor
---------
when adding a frame time marker, the new element messes up the mouse coordinates when drawing.
- probably need to add a curve fitting algorithm to smooth lines (esp when using a pen)
- need more tests
- there *might* be something wrong with the onion skin when switching between layers (i.e. from 2nd layer to 1st layer).
  I think I saw a scenario where multiple previous frames were being shown in the onion skin.

short-term
----------
- make context.lineJoin a variable that can be changed? i.e. have more options besides 'round'?
- when erasing, don't let cursor disappear on pointerdown event?
- when saving a project, make sure to include any timeline markers!
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- adjust eraser cursor image size?
- stop animation, play reverse?

long-term
---------
- be able to change frame order
- actually make some decent animation to prove its usability
- copy and paste?
- loopcut/move parts of canvas?
- be able to blur a section of the canvas?
- gradients?
