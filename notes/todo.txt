buggy stuff / refactor
---------
- need to refactor some Toolbar and Brush methods

- fix undo
  - going to a different frame and clicking undo overwrites the current layer with whatever layer the undo was for

- rotate image needs fixing

- need more unit tests

short-term
----------
- when saving a project, make sure to include any timeline markers!
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- eraser cursor that can also adjust size based on eraser size.
- stop animation, play reverse?
- rethink brush implementations
  - use a Brush class? some basic inheritance?
- when clicking on a frame in the animation timeline, also set current frame to that frame

long-term
---------
- be able to change frame order
- acutally make some decent animation to prove its usability
- make footer span the whole page (needs its own row?)
- more brush types
- copy and paste?
- loopcut/move parts of canvas?
- be able to blur a section of the canvas?
- gradients?
