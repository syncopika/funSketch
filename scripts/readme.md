a detailed description of the components in each script would be nice.    
     
***brushes.js***    
has a default, radial gradient, and fisheye brush.    
    
***filters.js***    
has many image filters.    
    
***experiments.js***    
just some new functions I'm playing with. right now I'd like to rotate the image by an arbitrary angle, which is way harder than I thought it would be. also, I just found out recently that the canvas API has its own rotate function, but I'd like to give it a try myself.
