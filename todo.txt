short-term
----------
- when saving a project, make sure to include any timeline markers!
- in Toolbar.js, a lot of stuff that happens in this.up() and this.down(), namely the canvas attribute changes, should be moved to SuperCanvas.js?
  also, there's duplicate code that can be reduced :|.
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- ERASER!
    - kinda hard? need a cursor that can also adjust size based on eraser size.
- stop animation, play reverse?
- rethink brush implementations

long-term
---------
- acutally make some decent animation to prove its usability
- make footer span the whole page (needs its own row?)
- more brush types
- copy and paste?
- loopcut/move parts of canvas?
- be able to blur a section of the canvas?
- gradients?
