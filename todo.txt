short-term
----------
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- need delete frame method
- make canvas area the whole section the canvas occupies

long-term
---------
- try typescript conversion? lol

bugs:
- loading a demo should also load frames to timeline :<
- clicking the arrow icons should produce the same effect as pressing a,d, left/right arrow keys
