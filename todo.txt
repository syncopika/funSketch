short-term
----------
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- need delete frame method
- make canvas area the whole section the canvas occupies
- make footer span the whole page (needs its own row?)
- stop animation, play reverse?

long-term
---------
- try typescript conversion? lol
