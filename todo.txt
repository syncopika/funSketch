short-term
----------
- in Toolbar.js, a lot of stuff that happens in this.up() and this.down(), namely the canvas attribute changes, should be moved to SuperCanvas.js?
  also, there's duplicate code that can be reduced :|.
- maybe add a context menu for the animation timeline?
	- i.e. besides being able to change the frame rate, set start/end points?
- be able to change layer order
- copy a layer to another frame
- make canvas area the whole section the canvas occupies
- make footer span the whole page (needs its own row?)
- stop animation, play reverse?

long-term
---------
- try typescript conversion? lol
